DIRECTIONS FOR STYLING YOUTUBE PAGE AND ADDING VIDEO

1. For the first 30 minutes of classwork time, your goal is to add flexbox properties in the correct block of code in CSS to get the layout to look and function like the mockup. 
    -Videos should maintain their size. 
    -As the screen gets smaller, the videos (and the information below) should wrap to new lines to continue to fit inside the given space. 

Only spend a maximum of 30 minutes on this before moving onto the next step of embedding videos. We want to make sure you have enough time to practice this skill before coming back to flexbox. 


EMBEDDING VIDEOS

2. In the youtube.html file, locate the divs that represent the red placeholders where videos will be: <div class="container-video-placeholder"></div>. You will be replacing these placeholders with actual videos.

    Videos 1-4 should be created by using <video> HTML tags.
    
        Video 1 should use the night-sky.mp4 file located in the public/videos folder. The video should have controls but not automatically start playing when the page loads.

        Video 2 should use the octopus.mp4 file located in the public/videos folder. It should play automatically but be muted and should have controls.

        Video 3 should use the northern-lights.mp4 file located in the public/videos folder. The video should not have controls and it should automatically start playing when the page loads. 

        Video 4 The fourth video in that row should use the waves.mp4 file located in the public/videos folder. The video should have controls but should not automatically start playing when the page loads.

    Videos 5-8 should be gifs that are embedded using <iframe> elements. 
        a. To get the code for each gif, follow the link provided below. 
        b. Click the "Embed" link on giphy's website. 
        d. Copy the given code. 
        e. Paste the code in the appropriate place in the youtube.html file. Remember, you're replacing the divs that create the red box placeholders in the youtube.html file: <div class="container-video-placeholder"></div>.
        
        Hint: You will have to take out some of the provided code from Giphy for sizing, etc. to get the gifs to show up in the same way as the mockup.

        The links for the gifs are:

    Videos 9 & 10 should be included into the page with the <embed> tag. The src attribute should link to the file location in your file structure (video 9: dandelion.mp4 & video 10: trees.mp4), and the type value should be "video/mp4"     

    Videos 11 & 12 should be included in the page by using the embed code given by YouTube. To embed videos from YouTube:
        a. Follow the provided links:
            i.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmK5-3ZhXX8
            ii. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4crvs-KTBw 
        b. Click "SHARE"
        c. Click "Embed"
        d. Copy the code provided in the <iframe> tag.
        e. Paste it in the appropriate spot in the youtube.html page. 

        Hint: You will have to take out some of the provided code from YouTube for sizing to get the gifs to show up in the same way as the mockup.

If you get done with all of these directions, move on to the Spotify challenge. If you've already done that, go back to the classwork from period 2 and continue coding the layouts for Twitter and Facebook.
