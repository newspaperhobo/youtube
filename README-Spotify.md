DIRECTIONS FOR STYLING SPOTIFY PAGE AND ADDING AUDIO

1. For the first 30 minutes of classwork time, your goal is to add flexbox properties in the correct block of code in CSS to get the layout to look and function like the mockup. 
    -The image, song title, and red placeholder div should all be in a row together.  
    -If the screen gets too small to contain all three elements, the elements should start to wrap onto a new line, but the elements themselves should remain the same size. 

Only spend a maximum of 30 minutes on this before moving onto the next step of embedding audio. We want to make sure you have enough time to practice this skill before coming back to flexbox. 

2. On the spotify.html page, there are 8 placeholders for you: <div class="placeholder-div-audio"></div>. For each of these, delete the placeholder and use the <audio> element (and any other needed tags) to embed all 8 mp3 files that are located in the public/audio folder. 

    a. All songs should include controls. 
    b. The 4th track should autoplay.
    c. The 5th and 6th tracks should autoplay on mute.
    d. The 7th track should automatically be muted until the unmute button is clicked even when the user presses play. It should not autoplay.
    e. The 8th track should loop back to the beginning and play over and over again when it gets to the end of the song. It should not autoplay.

HINT: You don't need two sources for the audio elements. If you were working on a professional site, it would be a good idea to have multiple formats in case a browser did not support one type, but for this classwork assignment, having one will suffice. 

NOTE: Some browsers won't autoplay. If you're using a browser that won't, like Chrome, include the code to make it autoplay, but don't worry if it doesn't work.

If you get done with all of these directions, move on to the YouTube challenge. If you've already done that, go back to the classwork from period 2 and continue coding the layouts for Twitter and Facebook.
